# Bonkers
A simple iOS SpriteKit based example game

- The goal is to cause as many collisions between the black checker piece and the red checker pieces as possible.
- Swipe the black checker piece to fling it toward other pieces.
- You may drag the black checker piece to a good starting point before flinging it, but be careful - don't let the black piece touch any red pieces while you are still dragging the black piece.
